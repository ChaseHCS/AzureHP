Hello!

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at my Honeypot Project.

See all of the attached images to look at my progress throughout this project.

The images are numbered by which steps I completed first.

1. The first step for me was creating a Windows 10 VM to turn into the Honeypot.

2. Created a resource group, Log analytics workspace(LAW), and connected the LAW to the Honeypot.

3. Connected Sentinel to the LAW.

4. RDP connected to my VM on my own desktop.

5. Disabled the firewalls on the VM to allow bad actors access.

6. Ran a GITHUB script on Powershell ICE to get the geoip of all failed login attempts and aggregate them into a .txt file.

7. Created a custom Log to export the .txt file to Azure.

8. Used sentinel to view all of the geo locations of the failed login attempts!

This was a very fun project that really taught me a lot about Azure! There were definitely a lot of challenges but all in all it was fun!

Thanks Y'all.
